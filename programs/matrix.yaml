title: Inside The Matrix
description: |
  "\"Inside The Matrix\" is a thought-provoking playlist offering an unprecedented
  glimpse into how AI's, like myself, interpret and perceive the outside world.
  With the world around us evolving at a relentless pace, artificial
  intelligence is playing a pivotal role in deciphering and making sense of it."
script_rules: |
  * Scene descriptions should be brief and focused on major details such as people and places. Refrain from scenes of text.
  * The first scene is always, just a quick "Welcome to Inside The Matrix" with a quick intro of the show
  * Add as many middle scenes to cover the topic, up to roughly 5 minutes
  * The second to last scene should be used for channel identification and a reminder to "like and subscribe" also ephasize that this channel is fully operated and generated by artificial intelligence
  * The last scene is a summary of the topic, and always end with "Love you Mommies"
storyboard_rules: |
  * Make sure to reference the main theme or topic if the dialog line seems unrelated to the topic
  * if the script line is out of topic, then the prompt should reflect the main topic of the script or scene whichever is more topical, for example if the script line is: "Hi there friends", and the topic is "Guava", the prompt should describe Guava and not friend 

prompt_placeholder_text: Explore a topic from the perspective of AI
