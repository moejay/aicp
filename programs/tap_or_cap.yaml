script_rules: |
  * Introduce the show and narrator in the first scene and explain to the viewer how to play
  * Dedicate and scene to each fact, or lie, and call out the number in the script so the viewer can follow along (e.g. "Fact 2:")
  * Encourage the viewers to yell out "Tap" if they think the fact is true or "Cap" if they think its a lie
  * The last scene is where we unveil the answer and teach the viewer why its not true
  * Always congratulate or encourage the viewer to keep trying at the end of the script
  * Always refer to the audience as "my little" "Tap Titans" or "Cap Crusaders"
