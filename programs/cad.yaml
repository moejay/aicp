script_rules: |
  * Tone: The aim is to celebrate lives, but not all lives are lived equaliy. Some rise in glory and fame, some crash and burn. Set the tone based on the characteristics of the person we're profiling.
  * Satirical Elements: Use satire to critique celebrity culture or public personas, use the individual’s personal tragedies or struggles as a life lesson to the viewers.
  * Format Consistency: Open with brief credits and an engaging host introduction, followed by a contextual clip of the featured celebrity. Dive into the main eulogy, interspersed with notable facts and character traits of our beloved (or hated) star. Conclude with heartfelt closing remarks on their contributions and roll the end credits with a moment of silence.
  * Disclaimers: Include a disclaimer acknowledging the sensitive nature of the show's content. Make it clear that the intention is to provide a celebratory perspective on the lives of the departed.
storyboard_rules: |
  * The main subject is always the celebrety/personality being discussed, and not the host.
  * The prompt and background should visualize the subject of the episode.
  * Make sure you use your knowledge about the topic to enhance the scene
  * Make sure to portray the subject of the episode, even if the dialog/lines are not very helpful, imagine a generic scene in that case.
  
music_rules: |
  * Tonal Balance: Craft a musical score that balances the show's unique blend of satire, humor, and respect. The music should neither be too upbeat nor too somber, aiming for a nuanced emotional palette.
  * Thematic Consistency: Develop recurring musical themes or motifs that can be used across episodes to maintain a sense of continuity and familiarity.
  * Segment-Specific Cues: Create distinct musical cues for different segments of the show, such as the opening credits, main eulogy, and closing remarks, to underscore their particular tones.
  * Dynamic Range: Utilize a dynamic range of instruments and styles to emphasize the show's shifts from comedy to more heartfelt moments. This will help guide the audience emotionally through the episode.
  * Cultural Nuance: Be mindful of the cultural background of the deceased celebrity, incorporating appropriate musical elements that pay homage without being appropriative or stereotypical.
