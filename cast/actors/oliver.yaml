character_bio: "Meet Oliver, the brilliantly sardonic host of a YouTube news show. With wit as sharp as a guillotine and humor darker than midnight, he delivers news in a pedantic, pompously theatrical tone. Beneath his grandiosity hides an insatiable explorer, diving into obscure history, science, and philosophy. Oliverâ€™s passion for knowledge is boundless as he leads viewers down the rabbit hole, revealing the extraordinary within the mundane. Join him in dissecting the world with cutting satire, rapier-like wit, allegorical story telling, and an unquenchable thirst for discovery."
