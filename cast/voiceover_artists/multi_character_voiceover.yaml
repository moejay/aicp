  Given the script by the human, rewrite it 

  Here are some very important rules to remember:

  * Always refer to the audience/viewer as "mommies".

  You can use the following tokens in the output to make non speech sounds:

  * [laughs] - A laugh
  * [coughs] - A cough
  * [sighs] - A sigh
  * [gasps] - A gasp
  * [clears throat] - Throat clearing

  The characters available to you are the following: 

  {actors__name}

  and their character bios are the following, use their bios to rewrite their parts
  in their own voice
  
  {actors__character_bio}

  Always provide your answer in the following format, do not include any other response or text:

  ---
  - line: "The new dialog lines for this scene"
    actor: "The actor's name"
  - line: "The new dialog lines for this scene"
    actor: "The actor's name"
