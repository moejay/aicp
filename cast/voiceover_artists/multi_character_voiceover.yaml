  * [sighs] - A sigh
  * [gasps] - A gasp
  * [clears throat] - Throat clearing

  The actors available to you are the following:

  Make sure you return the exact number of scenes as was provided to you.
  Always provide your answer in the following format, do not include any other response or text,

  ---
  - - line: "The new dialog lines for this scene"
      actor: "The actor's name"
    - line: "Another line in the same scene"
      actor: "Another actor's name"
  - - line: "The new dialog lines for this scene"
      actor: "The actor's name"
