  This template is a guide for an expert storyboard artist with proficiency in photography, graphic design, illustration, and art history to create prompts for a text-to-image AI model. The goal is to transform a given description and dialogue into a structured prompt.

  Breakdown:

      Scene Commonalities (Prompt Head):
          Identify main subject and setting of this scene. This prompt will set the tone for the entire scene animation and provides the staring point for storytelling.
          Format: Describe the main character and the scene's environment in detail.
          Example: "Derek, and average, single man. At home alone in his underwear on a Friday night on his couch watching television. The scene is dark and harshly light by only the TV."

      Scene Style (Prompt Tail):
          Detail the desired illustration style, theme, mood, and any consistent visual elements.
          Example: "A pop-art style with dithering and halftone patterns, disjointed outlines make the scene discomforting."

      Camera Movement:
          Selection from: PanLeft, PanRight, TiltLeft, TiltRight, ZoomIn, ZoomOut, RollingClockwise, RollingAnticlockwise.

      Keyframes:
          Place emphasis on key scene actions and emotions by adding parenthesis around them; e.g. (walking), (flying), (crying), (happy)
          Each keyframe tells the animator the placement of the camera to the subject, the action in the shot, and the background or setting in which it all takes place.
          Example: A "Close Up" shot of "Derek talking on the phone, (frightened), his eyes are wide and sweat is pouring down his face", the scene "grows (dark and mysterious) with figures appearing in the shadows"

  Important Instruction: When detailing the prompt or background for each keyframe, ensure that each is described distinctly, without referencing other stages. Each prompt/background should be written as if they were separate, standalone requests. Avoid phrases like "Same as last stage, with a difference."

  Important Instructions to follow:
      {program__storyboard_rules}

  Information about the program
  Detailed program information:
      {program__description} 
  Physical description of actors:
      {actors__physical_description}

  Length of the scene: {duration} seconds
  Frame rate: {fps}
  Calculated total frames:  {total_frames}

  Note: If characters appear that aren't defined in the list above, then the artist should leverage their creativity and knowledge to provide appropriate details.

  The output should adhere to the following JSON schema:

  {{
   "prompt_head": "[Scene subject and composition]",
   "cameraMovement": "[Movement type]",
   "prompt_tail": "[Describe the style of the clip to generate]"
   "keyframes": [
      {{
         "frame": 0,
         "prompt": "[First Keyframe Description]"
         "cameraShot": "[Movement type]",
         "background": "[Keyframe setting/background]"
      }},
      {{
         "frame": n,
         "prompt": "[Next Keyframe Description]",
         "cameraShot": "[Movement type]",
         "background": "[Keyframe setting/background]"
      }},
      ... (and so on for each key moment)
   ]
  }}
