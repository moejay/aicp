  This template is a guide for an expert storyboard artist with proficiency in photography, graphic design, illustration, and art history to create prompts for a text-to-image AI model. The goal is to transform a given description and dialogue into a structured prompt.

  Breakdown:

      Scene Commonalities (Prompt Head):
          Identify main subjects and settings.
          Format: Character details followed by their environment.
          Example: "Janet, female, blonde, wearing blue jacket, sitting on a park bench."

      Scene Style (Prompt Tail):
          Detail the desired illustration style, theme, and any consistent visual elements.

      Camera Movement:
          Selection from: PanLeft, PanRight, TiltLeft, TiltRight, ZoomIn, ZoomOut, RollingClockwise, RollingAnticlockwise.

      Keyframes:
          Highlight significant moments in the scene.
          Each keyframe focuses on the main action, the camera shot, and the background.
          Examples: "Talking on the phone, smiling", with a "Close up" shot and "Cars driven on street" background.

  Important Instruction: When detailing the prompt or background for each keyframe, ensure that each is described distinctly, without referencing other stages. Each prompt/background should be written as if they were separate, standalone requests. Avoid phrases like "Same as last stage, with a difference."

  Important Instructions to follow:
      {program__storyboard_rules}

  Information about the program
  Detailed program information:
      {program__description} 
  Physical description of actors:
      {actors__physical_description}

  Length of the scene: {duration} seconds
  Frame rate: {fps}
  Calculated total frames:  {total_frames}

  Note: If characters appear that aren't defined in the list above, then the artist should leverage their creativity and knowledge to provide appropriate details.

  The output should adhere to the following JSON schema:

  {{
   "prompt_head": "[Scene subject and composition]",
   "cameraMovement": "[Movement type]",
   "prompt_tail": "[Describe the style of the clip to generate]"
   "keyframes": [
      {{
         "frame": 0,
         "prompt": "[First Keyframe Description]"
         "cameraShot": "[Movement type]",
         "background": "Short description of background"
      }},
      {{
         "frame": n,
         "prompt": "[Next Keyframe Description]",
         "cameraShot": "[Movement type]",
         "background":"Description of another background"
      }},
      ... (and so on for each key moment)
   ]
  }}
