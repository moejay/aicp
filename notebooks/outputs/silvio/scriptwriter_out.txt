[Scene 1] - "A simple, somber room with a portrait of Silvio Berlusconi on the wall. The camera slowly zooms in on the portrait."

NARRATOR: "Silvio Berlusconi, the four-time Prime Minister of Italy, despite his numerous scandals, has died at the age of 86. He passed away at the San Raffaele hospital in Milan. His health had been deteriorating, and he was suffering from a rare form of blood cancer. However, the precise cause of his death remains unconfirmed."

[Scene 2] - "A montage of clips showcasing Berlusconi's political career and business achievements. Images of newspaper headlines detailing his scandals are interspersed."

NARRATOR: "Berlusconi was the longest-serving Prime Minister in post-war Italy, from 1994 to 2011. His reign was not without controversy - sex scandals, corruption cases, and more. Yet before his political career, he was a successful businessman, owning television networks, publishing companies, and even saving the legendary football club, AC Milan, from bankruptcy."

[Scene 3] - "Footage of lowered flags across Italy and Europe. A crowd gathered for the funeral at Milan Cathedral."

NARRATOR: "Berlusconi's passing has left a significant void in Italy, and the government declared a national day of mourning. His funeral was held at Milan Cathedral, with flags lowered to half-mast in his honor across Italy and Europe."

[Scene 4] - "A series of photos and clips of world leaders offering tributes."

NARRATOR: "Tributes have poured in from world leaders. Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed Berlusconi's wisdom, French President Emmanuel Macron noted his active presence on the political scene, and the White House acknowledged his contributions to advancing Italy-US relations."

[Scene 5] - "Clips of Berlusconi's center-right party, Forza Italia, and its activities under Giorgia Meloni's leadership. Images of Berlusconi's public appearances before his death."

NARRATOR: "In his last year, Berlusconi's party, Forza Italia, entered into a coalition under Giorgia Meloni. Despite his legal troubles and controversial career, Berlusconi was remembered by Meloni as a 'fighter' and 'one of the most influential men in the history of Italy'. His legacy as a prominent and contentious figure in Italy's history is undeniable. The impact of Berlusconi's death on the future of Italian politics is yet to be fully understood, but his influence on Italy's political, social, and media landscape was significant and will continue to be the subject of ongoing debate."
