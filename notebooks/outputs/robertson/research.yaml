Pat Robertson, a prominent religious broadcaster, died at the age of 93. His death was confirmed by his broadcasting network, the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), although the cause was not specified. Throughout his life, Robertson significantly influenced both religion and politics in the United States.

Born Marion Gordon "Pat" Robertson on March 22, 1930, in Lexington, Virginia, to Absalom Willis Robertson and Gladys Churchill Robertson, he had early connections to politics through his father, who served as a U.S. Representative and Senator from Virginia for 36 years. After graduating from Washington and Lee University, Robertson served as assistant adjutant of the 1st Marine Division in Korea. He later obtained a law degree from Yale University Law School but failed the bar exam and chose not to pursue a career in law.

He met his wife, Adelia "Dede" Elmer, at Yale in 1952. Initially interested in politics, Robertson underwent a religious transformation that led him to reject alcohol and take down a nude print from his home. He and his wife moved into a commune in New York City’s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, where Robertson began his ministry to the poor.

Robertson earned a master's in divinity from New York Theological Seminary in 1959. Shortly after, he purchased a bankrupt UHF television station in Portsmouth, Virginia, and established the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) on October 1, 1961. The network, established as a tax-exempt religious nonprofit, would become a significant source of revenue, disclosing $321 million in "ministry support" in 2022 alone.

He became known to many American households through the "700 Club," a program that applied a secular talk-show format to religious broadcasting. The show was born out of a telethon when Robertson asked 700 viewers for monthly $10 contributions.

Robertson made a significant foray into politics by seeking the GOP presidential nomination in 1988. He innovated the strategy of courting Iowa's network of evangelical Christian churches, finishing second in the Iowa caucuses, ahead of Vice President George H.W. Bush. Robertson later endorsed Bush, who won the presidency.

In 1989, Robertson started the Christian Coalition in Chesapeake. The coalition became a powerful political force in the 1990s, mobilizing conservative voters through grass-roots activities. By the time of his resignation as the coalition’s president in 2001, Robertson had helped cement the alliance between conservative Christians and the Republican Party.

Robertson's other enterprises included Regent University, an evangelical Christian school in Virginia Beach; the American Center for Law and Justice, which defends the First Amendment rights of religious people; and Operation Blessing, an international humanitarian organization. Despite his controversies, including blaming natural disasters on gays and feminists, and accusing Black Lives Matter demonstrators of being anti-Christian, he was described as a "happy warrior" who was soft-spoken, urbane, well-read, and charming【9†source】【10†source】【11†source】【12†source】【13†source】【14†source】【15†source】【16†source】【17†source】【18†source】【19†source】【20†source】.
