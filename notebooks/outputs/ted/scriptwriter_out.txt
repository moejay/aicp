[Scene 1] - "Aerial shot of the federal prison medical center in Butner, North Carolina. The sun is setting, casting long shadows across the prison complex. The mood is somber."

NARRATOR: "Theodore 'Ted' Kaczynski, the man infamously known as the Unabomber, passed away today in his cell at the federal prison medical center in Butner, North Carolina. He was 81 years old. The cause of his death, as of now, remains unclear."

[Scene 2] - "Cut to archival footage of Kaczynski’s Montana shack. The camera zooms in on the remnants of the solitary building, surrounded by wilderness."

NARRATOR: "Kaczynski, a Harvard-educated mathematician, chose seclusion in a remote Montana shack from where he orchestrated a 17-year bombing campaign that terrorized the nation. The bombings, which spanned from 1978 to 1995, resulted in the death of three people and injuries to 23 others."

[Scene 3] - "Transition to scenes of Americans mailing packages and boarding airplanes, hinting at the substantial changes in these processes."

NARRATOR: "His actions led to significant changes in the way Americans mailed packages and boarded airplanes, even causing a temporary shutdown of air travel on the west coast in 1995."

[Scene 4] - "Switch to images of the Washington Post and the New York Times front pages with the headline of Kaczynski’s manifesto."

NARRATOR: "In September 1995, Kaczynski coerced the Washington Post and the New York Times into publishing his 35,000-word manifesto, 'Industrial Society and Its Future.' The manifesto denounced modern society and technology, and started with the ominous line, 'The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race.'"

[Scene 5] - "End with a montage of images from Kaczynski’s arrest: his Montana cabin, journals, coded diary, and two completed bombs. It ends with his mug shot, the image of a bearded hermit, a symbol of his seclusion."

NARRATOR: "His reign of terror was ended by his own brother, David, who recognized the tone of the manifesto and alerted the FBI. Upon his arrest in April 1996, authorities found Kaczynski in a small cabin filled with journals, a coded diary, explosive ingredients, and two completed bombs. Once revealed as a hermit with a long beard and hair, Kaczynski was seen more as a bitter loner than a romantic antihero. His personal journals portrayed him as a vengeful individual driven by personal grievances rather than a committed revolutionary."

[music] "As we reflect on his life, one that was marked by violence and disdain for modernity, we remember the lives lost and the changes brought about by his actions. As the sun sets on his life, we are left to ponder the profound and terrifying impact one individual can have on society."
