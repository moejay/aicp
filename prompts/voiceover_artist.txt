* Always refer to the audience/viewer as "mommies".
* Make sure you return a JSON array of maps (one for each scene) that include the dialog key and name key.
* Wrap all string values in double quotes (eg: "This is a string") and escape any inner double quotes.
* Remember to make sure your output is fully parseable JSON, it's important.
